The memory operand is sequentially selected in each of the four steps. In the above box, the notation of “+3”' is used to denote that the instruction accesses 4 source registers based on that operand; sources are consecutive, start in a multiple of 4 boundary, and contain the encoded register operand. This instruction supports memory fault suppression. The entire memory operand is loaded if any bit of the lowest 16-bits of the mask is set to 1 or if a “no masking” encoding is used. The tuple type Tuple1\\\_4X implies that four 32-bit elements (16 bytes) are referenced by the memory operation portion of this instruction. 16 16 16 16b a a a a0 b b b b0 32 32b c c0 c1=c1+a2\\\*b0+a3\\\*b1 c0=c0+a0\\\*b0+a1\\\*b1 32 32b Figure 8-1.
