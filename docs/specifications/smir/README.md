# SMIR Specification

Version: **2.0-source-synchronised**  
Source baseline: `HexRaysSA/rax` `master` commit `7ff6953e9919916632e4c321a64a14fb1fac1f73`  
Generated: `2026-06-14`

This folder replaces the older SMIR v0.1 specification. The prior specification described a planned three-tier execution stack and marked JIT tiers as future. The current implementation has moved materially beyond that: `smir-jit` is a default feature, native lowering infrastructure exists, x86-64 and AArch64 runtime trampolines exist in `lower/runtime.rs`, the opcode set has expanded substantially, RISC-V and Hexagon lifters include architecture-specific exact semantic escape operations, and the optimizer contains frontier-aware region liveness.

## Normative source order

1. Rust source under `src/smir/` at the baseline commit is authoritative.
2. The root `README.md` is authoritative for high-level project intent and integration claims, unless a source file is more precise or newer.
3. This specification is a derived document. Where this text and source disagree, the source wins.
4. Old files in `docs/specifications/smir/` are historical context only.

## Terminology

The terms **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **MAY**, and **DEFINED BY SOURCE** are used in the RFC 2119 sense, except that this folder is a repository-internal engineering specification rather than an internet standard.
